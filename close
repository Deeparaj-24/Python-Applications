    Use SequenceMatcher to return list of the best "good enough" matches.
    
    word is a sequence for which close matches are desired (typically a
    string).
    
    possibilities is a list of sequences against which to match word
    (typically a list of strings).
    
    Optional arg n (default 3) is the maximum number of close matches to
    return.  n must be > 0.
    
    Optional arg cutoff (default 0.6) is a float in [0, 1].  Possibilities
    that don't score at least that similar to word are ignored.
    
    The best (no more than n) matches among the possibilities are returned
    in a list, sorted by similarity score, most similar first.
    
    >>> get_close_matches("appel", ["ape", "apple", "peach", "puppy"])
    ['apple', 'ape']
    >>> import keyword as _keyword
    >>> get_close_matches("wheel", _keyword.kwlist)
    ['while']
    >>> get_close_matches("Apple", _keyword.kwlist)
    []
    >>> get_close_matches("accept", _keyword.kwlist)
    ['except']
